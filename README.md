#   Gauss Elimination Calculator
A little research project made alongside the RISC-V demo in which my partner and I solved a system of linear equations by means of the Gaussian Elimination Method, as long as said system is compatible determined and the pivots of its equivalent echelon matrix representation are nonzero, using RISC-V Assembly language.
